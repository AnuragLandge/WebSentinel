# WebSentinel
## Project Overview
This project aims to classify websites as either benign or malicious by analyzing both the URL and the content of the website. The system utilizes two main approaches: the Benign Sentinel and the Malicious Oversight.

Benign Sentinel: Builds a baseline using known safe websites.
Malicious Oversight: Reviews site content for patterns indicative of malicious intent.
This combined approach enhances the ability to spot suspicious URLs and improves cybersecurity protocols by providing a proactive measure against threats.
